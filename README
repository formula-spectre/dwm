dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
it's from the suckless guys. I hate dwm honestly yet I use it.

TODO
====
make the thing fucking better
manage to make plumb work
switch to xmonad
undestand why the plumbing script works with xst but not alacritty

personal notes
===============
aslstatus originates from this:
https://notabug.org/dm9pZCAq/aslstatus

and these configs are basically 90%  based on this:
https://github.com/cyber-duk/dwm

also the plumbing scripts originates from luke smith but since I dislike him (and he never fucking published it) I'm not gonna credit him.
wait a minut-

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
also make sure to have dmenu and rofi if you want to use my scripts.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code. Obviouly, modifiy the thing to your setup.
